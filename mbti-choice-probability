### How Choices Impact MBTI:

Each user is essentially building their MBTI type through their responses. For example:
- If someone consistently chooses answers leaning towards extraversion, intuition, feeling, and perceiving, they'll end up with **ENFP**.
- If someone opts for introversion, sensing, thinking, and judging, they'll end up with **ISTJ**.

By understanding how each question maps to a specific MBTI dimension, it's possible to guide users towards their MBTI drink recommendation.
